# Train, Validation, and Test Datasets
### Overview

Machine learning models are meant to make inference on unseen data, thus the performance of the model predicting a new value is what matters.

Given that a ML model is trained in observed values, how to ensure that the model will perform resonable predicting new data?<br>

That's where splitting the data into training, cross-validation, and testing datasets comes in to play.<br>

Check out the notebook to see how this works in practice.
