# Machine Learning 

## Overview
This repository contains some of the cool things I've been studying in my journey in Machine Learning.


## PROJECTS
### 01. Neural_Network
Neural Network algorithm implementation from scratch for `regression` and `binary classification`.<br>
Includes a jupyter notebook with training of Neural net for regression.

### 02.Neural_Network_Multiclass_Classification
Neural Network algorithm implementation from scratch for `multiclass classfication`.
Includes a jupyter notebook with training of NN for multiclass classification.

### 03.train_cv_test_datasets_methodology
This quickly talks about how to split the data available for a ML project to be able to train different models, select the best among them, and estimate its general performance.

### 04.Collaborative_filtering
Implementation of unsupervised learning model `collaborative filtering` and application to movies recommentation.
