# Machine Learning 

## Overview
This repository contains some of the cool things I've been studying in my journey in Machine Learning.


## PROJECTS
### 01. Neural_Network
Neural Network algorithm implementation from scratch for `regression` and `binary classification`.<br>
Includes a jupyter notebook with training of Neural net for regression.

### 02.Neural_Network_Multiclass_Classification
Neural Network algorithm implementation from scratch for `multiclass classfication`.
Includes a jupyter notebook with training of NN for multiclass classification.

### 03.train_cv_test_datasets_methodology
This quickly talks about how to split the data available for a ML project to be able to train different models, select the best among them, and estimate its general performance.

### 04.Collaborative_filtering
Implementation of unsupervised learning model `collaborative filtering` and application to movies recommentation.

### 05.Regularization
Implementation of Neural Network model with Regularizaion and application for binary classification.

### 06.Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
When training a model in a large dataset, using mini-batches of data can speed up training.  

### 07.Adam Algorithm and Learning Rate Decay
Apply Adam to make the NN learn faster from the data. Apply Leraning Rate Decay to make the model converge effectivelly by decreasing the size of learning rate as the training progresses.
