# Machine Learning 

## Overview
This repository contains some of the cool things I've been studying in my journey in Machine Learning.


## PROJECTS
### 01. Neural_Network
Neural Network algorithm implementation from scratch for `regression` and `binary classification`.<br>
Includes a jupyter notebook with training of Neural net for regression.

### 02.Neural_Network_Multiclass_Classification
Neural Network algorithm implementation from scratch for `multiclass classfication`.
Includes a jupyter notebook with training of NN for multiclass classification.

### 03.Next- comming soon.
